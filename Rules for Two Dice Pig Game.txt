Rules for Two Dice Pig Game
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls two dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
* If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total. Player can hold or roll again.
* If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again.
* If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
* If two 1s are rolled, the player’s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins
